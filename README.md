# Numark's DJ2Go2 Touch mapping for Mixxx

Based on the [original version][original] by *Kafuzke* [Mixxx forum][mixxx-forum] user.

## Differences from the original version

- Issues with pitch faders fixed (following [*Pancake*'s recommendations][pancake])
- **Level** knobs mapped as **Quick Effect Super Knobs** instead of _pregain_
- The **Browse** know works when it's clicked too, i.e. it enters a selected playlist when focus on the left side of the library, and it cues a track when it's focused

## Installation

1. download [`DJ2GO2_Touch.midi.xml`](DJ2GO2_Touch.midi.xml) and [`Numark-DJ2Go2-scripts.js`](Numark-DJ2Go2-scripts.js) into Mixxx `controllers` folder (on macOS it should be `~/Library/Application Support/Mixxx/controllers`)
1. (re)start Mixxx
1. `Preferences -> Controllers -> DJ2GO2 Touch -> Load preset` and choose **Numark DJ2Go 2**

## Compatibility

Tested with [Mixxx][mixxx] `v2.2.3` and `2.3.0-beta` on *macOS Catalina* `v10.15.4`
